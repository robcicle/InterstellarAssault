# InterstellarAssault

Object-Orientated C++ Programming DirectX11 Game Project

A fresh take on the original concept of SpaceInvaders whilst incorporating new approaches.
Now being used as the main project for 3D Game Development LUA Scripting Project.

**The project was originally part of a separate GitHub repository and has since been moved to its own.**
**Hence why ALOT of commits are missing, these current ones relate to the LUA Scripting Project.**
